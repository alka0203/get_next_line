The most obvious part was a hollow, echoing quiet, made by things that were lacking. 
If there had been a wind it would have sighed through the trees, set the innâ€™s sign creaking on its hooks, 
and brushed the silence down the road like trailing autumn leaves. If there had been a crowd,
even a handful of men inside the inn, they would have filled the silence with conversation and laughter, 
the clatter and clamor one expects from a drinking house during the dark hours of night.
If there had been music...but no, of course there was no music. In fact there were none of these things,
and so the silence remained.
